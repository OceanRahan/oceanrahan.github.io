    <h1 class="section-title">Personal Interests</h1>

    <div class="about-content">
      <p>
        Beyond my work in AI and human-centered computing, I am deeply interested in creative
        and reflective pursuits that shape how I understand people, emotion, and storytelling.
      </p>

      <p>
        These interests influence my research in trauma-informed AI, narrative systems,
        and human-computer interaction. They help me think not only about intelligence,
        but about meaning, memory, and lived experience.

    <h2 class="section-title">Feline Companions</h2>

    <div class="about-content">
      <p style="font-size:14pt;">
       My lifelong affection for cats began in my early childhood, around the age of five or six, when my father brought one home as a mouser. This marked my first interaction with these excessively adorable creatures, and as we subsequently welcomed many cats into our home, I cultivated an unusual and profound empathy for them, feeling deeply connected from a very young age.</p>


    
<p style="font-size:14pt;">Now, I have two feline daughters, Lochon (the grumpy one), who is three years old, and Floria, who is a year and a half. Their personalities are quite different: the younger Floria is a quiet, sleep-loving cat, while Lochon, the older one, is vocal and constantly dashes around the house in seemingly endless loops. Occasionally, Floria will chase after her. Lochon tends to be anxious and paranoid, whereas Floria is very relaxed, and they don't have a harmonious relationship.

  <!-- PHOTOGRAPHY -->
  <section id="photography" class="section">
    <h2 class="section-title">Photography</h2>

    <div class="about-content">
      <p>Photography, for me, is a powerful tool to seize fleeting beauty and encapsulate significant moments in time. I find particular joy in framing the intricate artistry of the natural world through my lens. While I approach photography as a dedicated hobbyist, my aim is to craft images that possess a certain aesthetic appeal, capturing not just what is seen, but also the feeling it evokes. As a way to share some of this visual exploration, I also upload a selection of my photographs to <a href="https://unsplash.com/@oceanrahan">Unsplash</a>, where they can be freely enjoyed and used by others.</p>

                   <p>Reflecting on my younger years, living at home meant I often assumed the role of the family photographer, with my sister frequently being the subject of my early photographic endeavors. It's a slight irony that I rarely found myself on the other side of the lens during that period. Nonetheless, the act of revisiting those captured moments, now frozen in time, stirs a profound sense of nostalgia within me. It's an intricate blend of gentle melancholy for the passage of time and a genuine pleasure in reliving those cherished memories, a bittersweet journey back to moments that now exist as tangible images.</p>

  <!-- READING -->
  <section id="reading" class="section">
    <h2 class="section-title">Reading</h2>

    <div class="about-content">
       <p>When I was very young, I loved fairy tales. They felt like magical doors to amazing places, and I couldn't wait to read what happened next. I always wanted more, but soon I grew older and had other things to do.</p>

                   <p>Now that I'm an adult, those fairy tales don't seem real anymore. But when I see their bright covers in a bookstore, I still feel a little bit of that old magic. It's like the books haven't changed, but I have. When I was a teenager, I used to read books very quickly, sometimes finishing a whole novel in two days. I remember reading books like Bivutibhushan Bandyopadhyay's <string>"Pather Panchali"</strong>, Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay's <strong>"Pather Dabi"</strong>, and Rabindranath Tagore's <strong>"Golpo Guccho"</strong>, among countless others. Reading was something I shared with friends. During the holidays after exams, we would swap our books so we could read even more without having to buy them. These books were important to us as we grew up and learned about the world.</p>

                   <p>When I went to university, I didn't have as much time to read. I had to focus on my studies, and reading for fun became less of a priority. But I never stopped loving books. Now, I'm trying to read more again. It feels like going back to something I really enjoy, something that always made me happy and helped me learn. The magic of those first fairy tales and the deeper stories I read as a teen are still a part of me, and I want to bring reading back into my life.</p>

  <!-- DRAMATIC ART -->

    <h2 class="section-title">Dramatic Art</h2>

    <div class="about-content">
      <p>I find immense pleasure in attending theatre plays. They offer a refreshing escape from everyday life, allowing me to immerse myself in worlds and perspectives distinct from the scientific realm I often inhabit. Though my attendance is occasional, I'm consistently impressed by the talent of the actors, their ability to deliver lines and portray characters so vividly in the moment.</p>

                   <p>My first experience was with <strong>"Company"</strong>, a powerful portrayal of British colonial exploitation in Bengal and the fall of Siraj Ud-Doula. The powerful acting compelled me to explore further, leading me to Rabindranath Tagore's <strong>"Chitrangada"</strong>. This production offered a different dynamic, with a circular stage placing the performers right among the audience. The intimacy was striking, and the actors' unwavering focus, despite their nearness, was truly impressive. The entire experience was remarkably vibrant.</p>
